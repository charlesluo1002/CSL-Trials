R programs for PoS calculation in phase 3 with SGLT2i subgroup included

1. Phase3_PoS_SGLT2i_included.R
	program that estimates the Probability of success through simulation. Outputs tables of PoS with rows and columns as ACR GMR for different groups in phase 2a.


2. plot for epsilon elicitation.R
	Plot of the distribution of the ACR GMR ratios between 2 subgroups for different epsilons, extreme tails are highlighted.


3. Overall_power.R
	Phase 3 power where success requires both overall and SGLT2i subgroup outcomes to be significant.
