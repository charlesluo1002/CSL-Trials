Contains 3 R codes and a shiny App

1. Simulation_of_Bronze_Study.R
	Produces simulated conditional probabilities (operating characteristics), porbability of success and plots

2. phase2a_PoS_illustration_plots.R
	Produces illustration plots of the simulation process, outputs are included in 'Stats forum presentation'

3. Mixture model PoS.R
	Blank, in preparation for the possible mixture modeling of PoS for phase 2a outcome where we have a non-zero chance of no treatment effect.

4. Shiny
	Interactive app for the simulation of bronze study, requires a server to sustain it, not recommended for daily use, more for illustration purposes.
